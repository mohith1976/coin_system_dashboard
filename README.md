# 💰 Coin-Based User Engagement & Community Platform

A **MERN-stack application** that gamifies user engagement with a **coin economy system**.  
Users earn coins by completing activities (referrals, daily check-ins, ad interactions, social participation), while **Admins control the coin economy** through a **dynamic pool and redemption system**.  

The platform also lays the foundation for a **developer collaboration & community network**, enabling users to connect, build, and grow together. 

-----

## 📂 Repositories

The project is split into two repositories:

  - **User Backend (API for Users)** → Powers user authentication, rewards, transactions, redemption, communites join/create, performing activites to earn and the leaderboard.
  - **Admin  (API for Admins)** → Controls the coin pool, redemptions, fraud detection, and economy balancing.
